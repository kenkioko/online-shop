Models
------

Models belong in the ``App\Models`` namespace.
All models inherit the Laravelâ€™s ``Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`` class.

The ``\App\User`` Model is the Laravel's default user model.

For any extentions on the functions of the models use Laravel's facades
``Illuminate\Support\Facades``. within the namespace ``App\Facades``.
